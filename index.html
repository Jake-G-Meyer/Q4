			 <h4>The Full Story</h4>
			  <p>(Fun Fact: This is the bio I already did but copy and pasted.)</p>
	      <p>I was born on December 10, 2004 to Joseph Andrew Meyer and Pandora K Meyer in the St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, California. My younger brother Finn was born exactly two years and two days later on December 12, 2006. I went to Toluca Lake Elementary School for preschool-5th grade and Luther Burbank Middle School for 6th and 7th grade. In the Summer of 2018, we packed our bags and moved to Greenville, South Carolina for reasons that are still notably vague. The general belief is that we moved because my dad wanted to be closer to his family (his brother lives here), which makes sense, I guess. Anyways, for 8th grade, I went to Mauldin Middle School, which was a very different experience. Mauldin was, put simply, much more chaotic than Luther. Once 8th grade ended, I was moved to the school that I'm writing all this for: St. Joseph's Catholic School.</p>
      <h4> Where do I see myself in five years?</h4>
	      <p> Now that's a good question. I never think about what the future holds so I'm not too sure. I'm in 10th grade right now so I'll most likely be in college by then. Yeah, that's a lame answer, but were you really expecting much from a cynical sophmore?</p>
      <h4> Where do I see myself in ten years?</h4>
	      <p> Now that's an even better question because, again, I have no idea. By that time, I'll be free from the bounds of school, which means I'll defintely have a job. Oh, the horror! Maybe I'll be a therapist. It pays well and it would be very nice to help people with their problems. But again, I'm not 100% sure. That's life for you.</p>
